# Quadratic Function Grapher

This Python script uses the SymPy library for symbolic computation, Numpy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for plotting. It plots a quadratic function of the users choice and finds its vertex, x-intercepts, and nearest whole number coordinates.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have Python installed along with these libraries: SymPy, Numpy, Matplotlib. If they aren't already installed, you can add them using pip

#### How to put in equation (standard form)
x**2 is x squared
2*x is 2x and so on
Only standard form supported as of right now.
##### License


```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install sympy
